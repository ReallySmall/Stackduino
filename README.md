Stackduino is an open source project, which provides the instructions and code to build and program a selection of Arduino compatible control boards, designed to automate the photographic technique of focus stacking.

While focus stacking is the main aim of the project, its core function of 'move, take picture, repeat' could be applied to other applications such as 3d scanning or timelapse.
